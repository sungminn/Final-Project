# INFRARED MOTION SENSING MOOD LIGHT FOR SLEEP & THROWABLE ALARM CLOCK

Summary
- An infrared motion sensed mood light and a throwable alarm clock aiming at the concept of "sleep" is what we are going towards within this project. First, the throwable alarm clock contains a accelerometer, button, LED, and a simple audio as components that would fit inside a shell shaped as a ball. The alarm would be set with the button that calculates 2 hours per press. When the time runs out and the alarm goes off, LED light will light up as well as the audio. To turn it off, one would need to exceed a certain distance of x,y,z to turn off the alarm. In addition to our project, we have the motion sensing mood light that gets put under the bed that when it detects certain movement caught within the range, the light will turn on in a soft, relaxing color for a few minutes and turn off again. It's for the safety of people of all ages, to be moving in the dark when you were to wake up in the middle of the night to do certain things. 

Components
- THROWABLE ALARM CLOCK
- Button
- LED light (that changes color)
- Accelerometer
- Audio (buzzer)

MOOD LIGHT FOR SLEEP
- LED RGB strip
- Infrared motion sensor
- Timer(?)

OTHERS
- Plastic / Rubber sphere ball 
- Tiny breadboard
- Header
- Battery (two AA battery= 3V)

Challenges
- Our challenges would be the part where we have to combine everything (the alarm clock) inside a sphere ball all together, functioning properly. Coding for the timer to move in 2hours in range, and for the alarm clock to ring when a set time is finished and having it to function with a press of a button is our biggest challenge. We are also worried about the form being out of shape in which it might be hard to deliver our message to the audience when finished. My group also has limited experience with Arduino and coding but we think the project is doable but would need some support having to meet our expectations with our final project.
